## Authentication

This API uses token-based authentication. To obtain an authentication token, follow the login instructions below.

### Login

To log in and obtain a token, send a POST request to the /api-token-auth/ URL with your username and password:

POST /api-token-auth/
{
  "username": "your_username",
  "password": "your_password"
}

The server will return an authentication token that must be included in the headers of all subsequent authenticated requests:

Authorization: Token your_token

### Logout

To log out, you can simply remove the token from the client-side storage (e.g., session or local storage) or invalidate it if you have implemented a token revocation mechanism.

## Endpoints
